Data-Enabled Physics Course


(1) Derive equations of motion for a Double-Pendulum In a Cart (DPIC).

(2) Define initial conditions and animate a DPIC by solving a non-linear system of ODEs using sympy's function odeint.

(3) Train an agent (via reinforcement learning) to invert a double-pendulum by controlling the horizontal force imposed on the cart.
